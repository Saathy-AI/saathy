## üîÑ Pending Tasks (For Full Implementation)

### Code Migration
- [ ] Properly split `api.py` into router modules
- [ ] Implement actual service classes (not just stubs)
- [ ] Migrate connector implementations to `packages/saathy-connectors/`

- [ ] Migrate intelligence features to `packages/saathy-intelligence/`

### Import Updates
- [ ] Update all import statements to use new package structure
- [ ] Fix cross-package dependencies
- [ ] Update relative imports to absolute imports

### Testing
- [ ] Update test imports for new structure
- [ ] Create package-specific tests
- [ ] Add integration tests for new structure
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass

### Configuration
- [ ] Update all configuration paths
- [ ] Ensure environment variables work with new structure
- [ ] Update secret handling for new paths

### Enterprise Layer
- [ ] Create `apps/enterprise/` structure
- [ ] Implement feature flag system
- [ ] Create license management
- [ ] Set up enterprise package separation

### Documentation
- [ ] Complete all documentation pages

- [ ] Create architecture diagrams
- [ ] Add deployment guides

### CI/CD
- [ ] Test GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Set up automated releases
- [ ] Configure Docker Hub publishing
- [ ] Set up documentation deployment

## üìù Notes

The migration has successfully created the new structure and moved all files to their appropriate locations. The next phase involves:

1. **Refactoring the monolithic code** - Breaking down large files like `api.py` into proper modules
2. **Implementing proper services** - Converting stubs into actual implementations
3. **Testing everything** - Ensuring all functionality works in the new structure
4. **Updating imports** - Making sure all code references use the new paths

This migration sets up a clean, modular architecture that will support both open-source and enterprise features while maintaining clear separation of concerns.
