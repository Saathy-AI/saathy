# Settings Management Rules

* Use `pydantic-settings` BaseSettings for all configuration
* Environment variables should be UPPERCASE with underscores
* All settings must have type hints and sensible defaults
* Use `Field()` with `description` for documentation
* Implement `model_config` instead of nested `Config` class (Pydantic v2)
* Settings should be singleton imported as `settings = Settings()`
* Use `@lru_cache` for expensive computed properties
* Validate URLs with `HttpUrl` type from pydantic
* Use `SecretStr` for sensitive configuration values
