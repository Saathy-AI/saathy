# Security Guidelines

* Never run containers as root user
* Use non-root user ID 1000:1000 for application containers
* Implement rate limiting in nginx configuration
* Add security headers: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection
* Use strong SSL/TLS configuration
* Implement proper firewall rules documentation
* Secrets should never be hardcoded in any file
