# Observability Standards

* Use OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
* Instrument all HTTP endpoints automatically
* Add custom spans for business logic with `@tracer.trace`
* Use structured logging with `structlog`
* Exclude health check endpoints from tracing
* Add request ID correlation across logs and traces
* Use consistent span naming: `service.operation`
* Tag spans with relevant business context
* Implement graceful fallbacks when telemetry endpoints are unavailable
