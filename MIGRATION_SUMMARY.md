# Saathy Infrastructure Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully completed the migration from Ansible-based deployment to a simplified Docker Compose + deployment script approach for the Saathy OSS project. This migration provides a more maintainable, secure, and developer-friendly deployment solution.

## Migration Phases Completed

### âœ… Phase 1: Ansible Infrastructure Removal
- **Removed**: `infra/playbook.yml`
- **Removed**: `infra/inventory.ini`
- **Removed**: `infra/` directory and all Ansible roles
- **Verified**: No Ansible-related CI/CD jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

### âœ… Phase 2: Production Docker Compose Setup
- **Created**: `docker-compose.prod.yml` with three services:
  - `saathy-api`: FastAPI with Gunicorn, health checks, 1GB memory limit
  - `qdrant`: Vector database with persistent storage, 2GB memory limit
  - `nginx`: Reverse proxy with SSL/TLS, 512MB memory limit
- **Security**: All containers run as non-root user (1000:1000)
- **Reliability**: Health checks every 30s with 3 retries
- **Persistence**: Named volumes for data storage

### âœ… Phase 3: Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration
- **Created**: `nginx/nginx.conf` with:
  - Upstream backend to saathy-api:8000
  - SSL/TLS configuration (ready for Let's Encrypt)
  - Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection)
  - Rate limiting (100 requests/minute per IP)
  - Gzip compression enabled
  - Health check endpoint proxying
- **Created**: `nginx/ssl/` directory for certificate storage

### âœ… Phase 4: Production-Ready Deployment Script
- **Created**: `deploy.sh` with comprehensive functionality:
  - Git pull latest code
  - Docker build with --no-cache flag
  - Health check before replacing containers
  - Rollback capability if health check fails
  - Logging with timestamps
  - Error handling with proper exit codes
  - Cleanup of old unused images
  - Three modes: `--init`, `--rollback`, `--dry-run`

### âœ… Phase 5: Environment and Backup Management
- **Created**: `.env.example` with all required environment variables
- **Created**: `scripts/backup.sh` for Qdrant data backup with:
  - Compression and timestamping
  - Retention management (30 days default)
  - Metadata tracking
- **Created**: `scripts/restore.sh` for Qdrant data restoration with:
  - Backup validation
  - Pre-restore backup creation
  - Confirmation prompts
  - Force restore option

### âœ… Phase 6: Documentation Updates
- **Updated**: `README.md` with:
  - Removed all Ansible sections
  - Added "Quick Deploy" section with 3-step process
  - Added "Initial VPS Setup" section
  - Added "Monitoring and Maintenance" section
- **Created**: `docs/vps-setup.md` with comprehensive VPS setup guide:
  - Initial server configuration
  - Docker installation
  - SSL certificate setup (Let's Encrypt + self-signed)
  - Firewall configuration
  - Security hardening
  - Troubleshooting guide

## Security Improvements

### Container Security
- âœ… All containers run as non-root user (1000:1000)
- âœ… No direct port exposure except nginx 80/443
- âœ… Memory limits configured for all services
- âœ… Health checks prevent unhealthy containers from serving traffic

### Network Security
- âœ… Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute per IP
- âœ… Security headers in all responses
- âœ… SSL/TLS termination at nginx level
- âœ… Strong SSL configuration (TLS 1.2/1.3 only)

### Deployment Security
- âœ… Deployment script prevents root execution
- âœ… Error handling with proper exit codes
- âœ… Backup creation before deployments
- âœ… Rollback capability for failed deployments

## File Structure Created

â””â”€â”€ docs/
    â””â”€â”€ vps-setup.md          # Complete VPS setup guide
```

## Deployment Workflow

### Initial Setup
```bash
# 1. Follow VPS setup guide
# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
nano .env

# 3. Initial deployment
./deploy.sh --init
```

### Regular Deployments
```bash
# Standard deployment
./deploy.sh

# Test deployment (dry run)
./deploy.sh --dry-run

# Rollback if needed
./deploy.sh --rollback
```

### Backup Management
```bash
# Create backup
./scripts/backup.sh

# Restore from backup
./scripts/restore.sh qdrant-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.tar.gz
```

## Technical Specifications

### Service Configuration
- **FastAPI**: Gunicorn with 4 workers, health check on /healthz
- **Qdrant**: Persistent storage in named volume `qdrant_data`
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy with SSL/TLS, rate limiting, security headers

### Resource Limits
- **API Container**: 1GB memory
- **Qdrant Container**: 2GB memory  
- **Nginx Container**: 512MB memory

### Health Monitoring
- Health checks every 30 seconds
- 3 retry attempts before marking unhealthy
- 40-second start period for initial health check

### Backup Strategy
- Daily automated backups (via cron)
- 30-day retention policy
- Compressed tar.gz format
- Metadata tracking for each backup

## Validation

Run the validation script to verify the migration:
```bash
./validate-setup.sh
```

This script checks:
- âœ… All Ansible files removed
- âœ… Production Docker Compose configured
- âœ… Nginx configuration with security
- âœ… Deployment script functionality
- âœ… Backup/restore scripts
- âœ… Documentation updated
- âœ… Security configurations applied

## Benefits of Migration

### Simplicity

- **After**: Single deployment script with clear workflow

### Security
- **Before**: Basic security configuration
- **After**: Comprehensive security headers, rate limiting, non-root containers

### Maintainability
- **Before**: Ansible dependencies and complex state management
- **After**: Simple Docker Compose with clear service definitions

### Developer Experience
- **Before**: Required Ansible knowledge and inventory management
- **After**: Standard Docker Compose commands and simple scripts

### Monitoring
- **Before**: Basic health checks
- **After**: Comprehensive health monitoring with rollback capability

## Next Steps

1. **Environment Configuration**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your API keys
2. **VPS Setup**: Follow the complete guide in `docs/vps-setup.md`
3. **Initial Deployment**: Run `./deploy.sh --init` for first-time setup
4. **SSL Setup**: Configure Let's Encrypt certificates for HTTPS
5. **Monitoring**: Set up automated backups and monitoring

## Support

For issues and questions:
1. Check the logs: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs`
2. Verify configuration: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml config`
3. Review the VPS setup guide: `docs/vps-setup.md`
4. Run validation: `./validate-setup.sh`
