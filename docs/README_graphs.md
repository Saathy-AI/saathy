## üõ†Ô∏è Generating Graphs

### Prerequisites

1. **Python Dependencies**: The script will automatically install required Python packages
2. **Graphviz**: Required for image generation
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install graphviz
   
   # macOS
   brew install graphviz
   
   # Windows
   # Download from https://graphviz.org/download/
   ```

### Quick Start

Run the generation script from the project root:

```bash
./scripts/generate_graphs.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r scripts/requirements-graphs.txt

# Generate graphs
python scripts/generate_architecture_graphs.py
```

### Output

Graphs are saved as PNG files in `docs/graphs/` directory.

## üìñ Documentation

- **Markdown Documentation**: `docs/architecture_graphs.md` - Contains all graphs in Mermaid format
- **Generated Images**: `docs/graphs/` - PNG files for each architecture view

## üîß Customization

The graph generation script (`scripts/generate_architecture_graphs.py`) can be customized to:

- Modify graph styles and colors
- Add new architecture views
- Change output formats
- Adjust graph layouts

## üìã Graph Types

### Mermaid Graphs (Markdown)
- Rendered directly in GitHub/GitLab
- Version controlled
- Easy to edit and maintain

### PNG Images (Generated)
- High-quality visual output
- Suitable for presentations
- Standalone files

## üéØ Usage Scenarios

1. **Architecture Documentation**: Include in technical documentation
2. **Onboarding**: Help new developers understand the system
3. **Presentations**: Use in technical presentations
4. **Planning**: Visualize system changes and improvements
5. **Troubleshooting**: Understand component relationships

## üîÑ Maintenance

- Update graphs when architecture changes
- Regenerate images after significant modifications
- Keep markdown documentation in sync with code
- Review graphs during code reviews

## üìû Support

For issues with graph generation or architecture questions:

1. Check the script output for error messages
2. Verify Graphviz installation
3. Review Python dependencies
4. Consult the main project documentation
